# StockHub
Team-built BSc 2024 web app for Gaza aid stock.

This is a web app I worked on as part of my BSc graduation project in 2024 at Al Azhar University, Gaza. Teaming up with three classmates, we created a tool to manage inventory for humanitarian aid in Gaza—a project I’m proud to have contributed to.

## Purpose  
StockHub helps track warehouse stock through a web interface, aiming to streamline aid logistics and get supplies where they’re needed most.

## Technologies  
- ASP.NET with C# (backend)  
- JavaScript and jQuery (frontend)  
- SQL (database)  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/TareqDV7/StockHub.git`  
2. Open it in Visual Studio (2022 recommended)  
3. Configure the SQL database (details in `web.config`)  
4. Hit F5 to launch with IIS Express  

## Notes  
This was a collaborative effort for our degree—my piece of a functional system built from scratch. It’s not perfect, but it works, and I’m excited to keep improving my skills from here!
